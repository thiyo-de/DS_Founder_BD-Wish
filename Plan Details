**How “credits” work**

* Cloudinary uses a credit system. Credits are consumed by **storage**, **bandwidth (delivery)**, and **transformations** (resizing, cropping, filters) of images/videos. ([Capterra][3])
* You need to monitor which aspect is being exhausted– sometimes transformations or bandwidth usage (from many views) eats credit fast.
* Going over your limits usually means buying more credits or upgrading plans.

If you like, I can also get you **Supabase + Cloudinary cost estimates** for your use case (say ~1,000 users, ~500 images) so you see what your bill *might* look like. Do you want me to do that for your certificate site?

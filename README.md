# 🎉 DS Founder Birthday Wishes Platform

A heartfelt digital tribute platform to celebrate the visionary leadership of your founder by collecting wishes, messages, photos, audio, and video from team, partners, and community.

## 🧾 About

This platform is built to host a dedicated “wishes wall” for founder birthday celebrations (or similar events). Contributors can share wishes via text, upload images, record or upload audio/video, and see all messages displayed in an attractive and engaging layout. The goal is to centralize well-wishes in one place, accessible publicly or privately, depending on settings.
